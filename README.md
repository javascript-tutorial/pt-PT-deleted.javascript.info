üéâ Thank you!

Your name and the contribution size will appear in the "About project" page when the translation gets published.

P.S. The full list of languages can be found at <https://github.com/javascript-tutorial/translate>.

## Structure

Every chapter, an article or a task resides in its own folder.

The folder is named `N-url`, where `N` ‚Äì is the number for sorting (articles are ordered), and `url` is the URL-slug on the site.
=======
See <https://github.com/javascript-tutorial/translate> for the details.

## Contributions

We'd also like to collaborate on the tutorial with other people.

Something's wrong? A topic is missing? Explain it to people, add as PR üëè

**You can edit the text in any editor.** The tutorial uses enhanced "markdown" format, easy to grasp. And if you want to see how it looks on-site, there's a server to run the tutorial locally at <https://github.com/javascript-tutorial/server>.  

The list of contributors is available at <https://javascript.info/about#contributors>.
>>>>>>> 19223ae762f03cdff4e83f6f963f4f427af93847

The folder has one of files:

- `index.md` for a section,
- `article.md` for an article,
- `task.md` for a task formulation (+`solution.md` with the solution text if any).

A file starts with the `# Title Header`, and then the text in Markdown-like format, editable in a simple text editor. 

Additional resources and examples for the article or the task, are also in the same folder.

## Translation Tips

The translation doesn't have to be word-by-word precise. It should be technically correct and explain well.

If you see that the English version can be improved ‚Äì great, please send a PR to it.

### Text in Code Blocks

- Translate comments.
- Translate user-messages and example strings.
- Don't translate variables, classes, identifiers.
- Ensure that the code works after the translation :)

Example:

```js
// Example
const text = "Hello, world";
document.querySelector('.hello').innerHTML = text;
```

‚úÖ DO (translate comment):

```js
// Ejemplo
const text = 'Hola mundo';
document.querySelector('.hello').innerHTML = text;
```

‚ùå DON'T (translate class):

```js
// Ejemplo
const text = 'Hola mundo';
// ".hello" is a class
// DO NOT TRANSLATE
document.querySelector('.hola').innerHTML = text;
```

### External Links

If an external link is to Wikipedia, e.g. `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript`, and a version of that article exists in your language that is of decent quality, link to that version instead.

Example:

```md
[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) is a programming language.
```

‚úÖ OK (en -> es):

```md
[JavaScript](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) es un lenguaje de programaci√≥n.
```

For links to MDN, that are only partially translated, also use the language-specific version.

If a linked article has no translated version, leave the link "as is".


## Running locally

You can run the tutorial locally, to immediately see the changes on-site.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The server is at <https://github.com/javascript-tutorial/server>. 
=======
Each of these files starts from the `# Main header`.

It's very easy to add something new.
